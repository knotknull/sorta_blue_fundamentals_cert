## Language of Cloud Computing
##


High Availability:
  - hardware fails, replace instantly
  - clusters ensure HA

Fault Tolerance:
  - resilience
  - zero downtime: faults caused by Azure are mitigated by Azure

Disaster Recovery:
  - Plan to recover from catastrophic disaster
    - RTO: Recover Time  Objective
    - RPO: Recover Point Objective

--Time-->>
     ------------------X------------------------------------
              |      Outage               |
              |        |                  |

# Scalability
Scale Out:  Add more resources
Scale Up :  Bigger resources

# Elasticity
  - Ability to quickly expand or decrease computing resources
    (Not just VMs)  >> Elasticity enables scaling

# Agility
  - Ability to rapidly develop, test and deploy software that drives growth



## Language of Cloud Economics
##

# CapEx / OpEx

Capital Expenditure:  Money spent by business or org on acquiring or maintaining,
    fixed assets such as land, buildings and equipment

Operational Expenditure:  Ongoing cost for running a product, business or system
    on a day-to-day basis, including annual costs.


# Cloud Pricing Models
  - Hourly Pricing: VMs, App Services
  - Consumption: pay for resources used
          - per execution
          - per second
          - combination (exec x secs)

# Cloud Service Models
 - Infrastructure-as-a-service
 - Platform-as-a-service
 - Software-as-a-service

 - IaaS
   - Infrastructure == servers
   - Scaling is fast
   - VMs & Servers, Networks, Physical Buildings

 - PaaS
   - Iaas + Middlware, Tools, DBs, etc.
   - Supports web app life cycle
   - Avoids software licenses

 - SaaS
   - Iaas + PaaS + Applicatons
   - Provide a managed service / pay access fee
   - no maintenance ex. Office365

 - Serverless
   - no servers to manage
   - ex. Azure Functions

# Azure Marketplace
 - Solutions and services: Apps, VMs, services, etc.
 - Azure App Store
 - Use from: Portal, CLI, PowerShell
 - Can publish own service via Marketplace

# Cloud Architecture Models
 - Private Cloud: Services offered to certain users
   Pros:
      - Complete control of Infrastructure
      - Benefits of public cloud
      - Better security and privacy
   Cons:
      - Maintenance / Staffing

 - Public Cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.
   Pros:
      - No hardware purchase
      - low monthly fees
   Cons:
      - No control over features and versions
      - No physical access

 - Hybrid Cloud: Private + Public Cloude
   Pros:
      - Avoid disruptions and outages
      - Adhere to regulation, governance
      - Span both public / private clouds
      - Alleviate CapEx investments
      - Allow fast scaling

   Cons:
      - Complex Infrastructure

## Regions and Availability Zones
##

# Region
  - A region is a set of data centers deployed within a latency-defined
    perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network.

      - Region has more than one data center
      - Regional low-latency network:  fiber connection between data centers

  - Chosing a region:
      - Choose a region closest to your users
      - Some features aren't in all regions.
      - Price varies by region

# Paired Region
  - Paired within same geographic area (except Brazil South)
        East US paired w/ West US
        Australia East paired w/ Australia Southeast
        NOTE: Brazil South paired w/ South Central US

  - Outage Fail-over:
      - If primary region has an outage you can fail-over to secondary region

  - Planned Updates:
      - Serializes platform updates, only one region is updated at one time

  - Replication
      - Some services used paired regions for replication

# Availability Zones
  - Unique physical locations within a region (1 or more data centers)
  - Each zone has its own power, cooling and networking
  - Each region has a minimum of three zones.

  +----------------------------------+
  | Region                           |
  |                                  |
  |  [Availability]   [Availability] |
  |  [   Zone 1   ]   [    Zone 2  ] |
  |                                  |
  |          [Availability]          |
  |          [   Zone 3   ]          |
  |                                  |
  +----------------------------------+


## Resource Groups and
## Azure Resource Manager
##

# Resource Group
  - All resources are within a resource group
  - Resource Groups are NOT a resource !!
      - they are a container for resources

  - Each resource can ONLY EXIST in a single Resource Group
  - Add / remove resources to any resource group at any time
  - Can move a resource from one resource group to another
  - Resources from multiple regions can be in one resource group
  - Can be used as Access Control
      - Can give users access to a resource group and everything in it

  - Resources can interact with other resources from different resource groups
  - Resource group has location or region because it
    stores meta data about resources within it

# Azure Resource Manager
 - deployment and management services for Azure
 - creates, updates, deletes all resources
 - all interaction w. Azure Resources go thru Azure Resource Manager
    (Portal, SDK, PowerShell, CloudShell, Rest)

    Benefits:
      - Can deploy, manage, monitory resources as a group
      - Consistent deployment no matter which tool
      - Define dependencies between resources
      - Assign access rights to resources via ARM
      - Tag resources / use for billing
