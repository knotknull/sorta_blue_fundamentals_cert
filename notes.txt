# Scalability
Scale Out:  Add more resources
Scale Up :  Bigger resources

# Elasticity
  - Ability to quickly expand or decrease computing resources
    (Not just VMs)  >> Elasticity enables scaling

# Agility
  - Ability to rapidly develop, test and deploy software that drives growth



## Language of Cloud Economics
##

# CapEx / OpEx

Capital Expenditure:  Money spent by business or org on acquiring or maintaining,
    fixed assets such as land, buildings and equipment

Operational Expenditure:  Ongoing cost for running a product, business or system
    on a day-to-day basis, including annual costs.


# Cloud Pricing Models
  - Hourly Pricing: VMs, App Services
  - Consumption: pay for resources used
          - per execution
          - per second
          - combination (exec x secs)

# Cloud Service Models
 - Infrastructure-as-a-service
 - Platform-as-a-service
 - Software-as-a-service

 - IaaS
   - Infrastructure == servers
   - Scaling is fast
   - VMs & Servers, Networks, Physical Buildings

 - PaaS
   - Iaas + Middlware, Tools, DBs, etc.
   - Supports web app life cycle
   - Avoids software licenses

 - SaaS
   - Iaas + PaaS + Applicatons
   - Provide a managed service / pay access fee
   - no maintenance ex. Office365

 - Serverless
   - no servers to manage
   - ex. Azure Functions

# Azure Marketplace
 - Solutions and services: Apps, VMs, services, etc.
 - Azure App Store
 - Use from: Portal, CLI, PowerShell
 - Can publish own service via Marketplace

# Cloud Architecture Models
 - Private Cloud: Services offered to certain users
   Pros:
      - Complete control of Infrastructure
      - Benefits of public cloud
      - Better security and privacy
   Cons:
      - Maintenance / Staffing

 - Public Cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.
   Pros:
      - No hardware purchase
      - low monthly fees
   Cons:
      - No control over features and versions
      - No physical access

 - Hybrid Cloud: Private + Public Cloude
   Pros:
      - Avoid disruptions and outages
      - Adhere to regulation, governance
      - Span both public / private clouds
      - Alleviate CapEx investments
      - Allow fast scaling

   Cons:
      - Complex Infrastructure

##  Azure Architecture
##########################################################################

## Regions and Availability Zones
##
# Azure Geographies
  - Americas
  - Europe
  - Asia Pacific
  - Middle East and Africa

# Region
  - A region is a set of data centers deployed within a latency-defined
    perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network.

      - Region has more than one data center
      - Regional low-latency network:  fiber connection between data centers

  - Chosing a region:
      - Choose a region closest to your users
      - Some features aren't in all regions.
      - Price varies by region

# Paired Region
  - Paired within same geographic area (except Brazil South)
        At least 300 miles away
        East US paired w/ West US
        Australia East paired w/ Australia Southeast
        NOTE: Brazil South paired w/ South Central US

  - Outage Fail-over:
      - If primary region has an outage you can fail-over to secondary region

  - Planned Updates:
      - Serializes platform updates, only one region is updated at one time

  - Replication
      - Some services use paired regions for replication

# Availability Zones
  - Unique physical locations within a region (1 or more data centers)
  - Each zone has its own power, cooling and networking
  - Each region has a minimum of three zones.

  +----------------------------------+
  | Region                           |
  |                                  |
  |  [Availability]   [Availability] |
  |  [   Zone 1   ]   [    Zone 2  ] |
  |                                  |
  |          [Availability]          |
  |          [   Zone 3   ]          |
  |                                  |
  +----------------------------------+



## Resource Groups and
## Azure Resource Manager
##

# Resource Group
  - Logical container for resources deployed to Azure
  - All resources are within a resource group
  - Resource Groups are NOT a resource !!
      - they are a container for resources

  - Each resource can ONLY EXIST in a single Resource Group
  - Add / remove resources to any resource group at any time
  - Can move a resource from one resource group to another
  - Resources from multiple regions can be in one resource group
  - Can be used as Access Control
      - Can give users access to a resource group and everything in it
  - Delete a resource group and all resources it contains are deleted.

  - Resources can interact with other resources from different resource groups
  - Resource group has location or region because it
    stores meta data about resources within it

# Azure Resource Manager
 - deployment and management services for Azure
 - creates, updates, deletes all resources
 - all interaction w. Azure Resources go thru Azure Resource Manager
    (Portal, SDK, PowerShell, CloudShell, Rest)

    Benefits:
      - Can deploy, manage, monitor resources as a group
      - Consistent deployment no matter which tool
      - Define dependencies between resources
      - Assign access rights to resources via ARM
      - Tag resources / use for billing

     VM=Virtual Machine
     UD=Update Domain




## Scale Sets
##
  Scale Sets:  create and manage group of identical, load balanced VMs

  - provide baseline VM and create clones
  - Multiple identical VMs
  - High Availability
  - Auto Scaling: automatically match demand by adding/removing VMs from scale set
                  based on resource usage increase / decrease
  - Large Scale:  Run up to 1000 VMs in a single scale set.
  - No extra cost


## App Services
##
  App Services == PaaS part of Azure Compute
  Fully managed platform (Servers, Network, Storage, etc.) managed by Azure
  3 Categories:
  Web Apps: websites and online apps
      - Runs on Windows and Linux
      - Languages:  .Net, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby
      - Azure integration for easier deployment
      - Auto-scaling and load balancing

  Web Apps for containers: deploy / run containerized apps in Azure
      - Container = self-contained application
      - All dependencies are shipped inside the container
      - Deploy anywhere with a consistent experience

  API Apps: expose and connect data backend
      - Range of programming languages
      - Range of ways to secure

NOTE:  AppService (app) resides in AppServicePlan (host)

## Azure Container Instances
##
  - Manage Dependencies
  - Less overhead than VMs
  - Increased portability, deploy to various OS / HW
  - Efficient: scaling / patching simpler
  - Consistency: operation teams rely on container sameness

 Workflow:

 [SDLC]  -->> [App in Container] -->>  [Azure Container Instances]

  Azure Container Instances:
    - Azure service for running container workloads
    - On demand, run container without managing VM
    - Works w/ Portal, CLI, PowerShell


## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
##

  - Replicate Container Architectures
      - reuse container arch using kubernetes

  - Standard Azure Services Included
      - don't have to worry about infrastructure
      - elastic provisioning, IAM

  - Global Reach
      - Use Kubernetes w/ supported Azure Regions and on-prem Azure Stack


## Azure Container Registry (ACR)
##
  - Service keeps track of current container images
  - Manages files and artifacts for containers
  - Feeds container images to ACI and AKS
  - Use Azure Identity and security features

## Functions
##
  - Smallest (and larges ?) compute service on Azure
  - A single function of compute
  - Called, or invoked via a standard web address (URL)
  - Runs once and stops

  Architecture:
    - Runs on VM
    - No maintenance / processes / Nothing VM related
    - Only focus on functionality

  Benefits:
    - Only runs when needed
      - no traffic = no resource usage
    - Saves money
      - don't pay for functionality when not used
    - Resilience
      - function failing doesn't affect other function instances

##  Networking
##########################################################################

## Virtual Network <***>
##

  - No physical network, network is abstracted


# Address Space:  Range if IP addresses available
                  192.168.0.1 - 192.168.0.252

  - Address space assigned to VNet
  - Every device assigned to VNet gets IP Addr within Address Space

# Subnet:  Segment VNet
          Split Address Space among Subnets

    VNet_1   =    192.168.0.001 - 192.168.0.252
      Subnet_1 =  192.168.0.001 - 192.168.0.016
      Subnet_2 =  192.168.0.017 - 192.168.0.032
      Subnet_3 =  192.168.0.033 - 192.168.0.252

  - Resource Grouping : group resources on same subnet
  - Address Allocation: more efficient to allocate addresses on smaller subnet
  - Subnet Security   : Use network security group to secure individual subnets

# Subnet Regions and Subscriptions
  - VNet belongs to a single region
      NOTE: Every resource on VNet must be in same region too
            Can connect VNets across regions

  - VNet belongs to just one subscription
      Subscription can have multiple VNets

# Advantages
  - Scaling:
        can add more VNets or more addresses to VNets
  - HA:
        Peering VNets, Load Balancer, VPN Gateway all increase availability
  - Isolation:
        Manage / organize resources with subnets and network security groups


## Load Balancer
##
  Load Balancer: distributes new inbound flows that arrive on Load Balancer to
           backend pool instances, according to rules and health probes
           health probe checks to ensure back end instance can receive data
Usage:

 - TCP / UDP Traffic
 - Internal Networks
 - Port Forwarding (traffic forwarded to specific machine)
 - Outbound Traffic:  allow outbound connectivity to VMs


## VPN Gateway
##

Virtual Network Gateway: 2 or more VMs deployed to Gateway Subnet
    - VMs in Gatway Subnet are created when Virtual Network Gateway is created


VPN Gateway: Specific type of Virtual Network Gateway
        Sends encrypted traffic from Azure VNet and On-Prem Network over Public Internet



  +----------------------------+                +----------------------------+
  | Azure VNet                 |                | On Premise                 |

  - Multi-site hosting:  Use same application gateway for up to 100 websites
  - Cookie affinity:  keep session on same server
  - SSL Termination: Manage SSL Certificates
  - URL rule-based routes
  - Rewrite HTTP Headers


## Content Delivery Network
##

Content Delivery Network (CDN): distributed network of servers that deliver
  web content close to users.

Benefits:
  - Better Performance

##########################################################################
##  Authentication & Authorization
##########################################################################


##  Identity Services
##

Authentication: Confirm user is the user
                confirm identity
                first test of access

Authorization : Provide access to resources
                comes after authentication
                do you get access
                granular control

# Access Management
  - Auth / Auth
  - Keep out unauthorized



##  Azure Active Directory
##

# Active Directory
  - traditional office use
  - AD not designed for web
  - AD authentication uses services that aren't available on Azure

# Azure Active Directory
  - AD IS NOT AAD
  - AAD is a service

  NOTE: You can't have an Azure account without and AAD service.

  - Every Azure account needs a first user (owner) and this user is
    in the initial AAD instance

# Tenant:   Tenant == AAD instance

  - tenant represents an organization within Azure
  - A tenant is a dedicated instance of AAD that an organization
    receives when signing up for Azure
        - first thing created in an Azure Account
  - One user - One Tenant
        - each user an only belong to single tenant
        - BUT users can be guests of other tenants

  NOTE: Each tenants is distinct and separate from other AAD tenants


# Subscription
  - Billing Entity
      - all resources within a subscription are billed together

  - Cost separation
      - can have multiple subscriptions within a tenant (separate costs)

  - Payment stopped, services stopped

# Hybrid Cloud Architecture


    +--------------+      +--------+      +----------+
    |  On-Premise  | ===> |  AAD   | ===> |  Azure   |
    +--------------+      +--------+      +----------+


##  Mult-Factor Authentication
##
- Built into Azure Active Directory
- At least 2 ways of authentication:
    - Something you know
    - Something you have (app, fob)
    - Something you are  (biometrics)

email addr / password  --------->> SMS Text to Mobile number
(something you know)                  (something you have)
